<p>Now that you have a better idea of the steps you need to follow to succeed in a coding interview, I recommend you do the below exercise:<br><br>1. Try and go through the 15 steps on your own and answer the same question as in the Google Interview in your own language by yourself or in front of a friend (or a fellow student on Discord). Share your code with everyone in our private Discord community in the <strong>#interview-questions </strong>channel. <br><br>2. Rewatch the Google interview video and notice how you understand the steps a lot better now. Don't worry though, by the end of this course, I am going to show you this video one last time and you will see how it will all make sense and become second nature to you even more! <br><br>Once done, keep going to the next video :)</p>
