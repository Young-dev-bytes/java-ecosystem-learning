<p>Every month in the community, we will have <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/community/coding-challenges/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>coding challenges</strong></a> for you to participate in, <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>monthly industry blogs</strong></a> and other<strong> </strong><a href="https://zerotomastery.io/resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>top free resources</strong></a> emailed to you. We also have annual events like <em>Advent of Code</em>, <em>Hacktoberfest </em>, and <em>Frosty February&nbsp;Hackathon</em>, plus some <em>giveaways </em> as well. <br><br>Make sure you have your email settings on Udemy to allow this, as every month we will be emailing you a community update email where we list all of the new challenges, free resources, videos and giveaways.<br><br>Some students have mentioned they do not receive these emails and it's mainly because of this <em>(Go to Your profile Icon and click: </em><strong><em>Account &gt;&nbsp;Notification&nbsp;Settings</em></strong><em>)</em>. Make sure you have these 2 boxes checked if you want to receive the monthly email like in the image below.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2021-03-09_14-13-22-603210afd08757facbdaf09b687c3c54.png"></figure><p><br><br><br><strong>PS.
