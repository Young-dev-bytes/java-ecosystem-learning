<p>When we build data structures from scratch in this course, we will be using the Javascript's <code>Class</code> keyword to create these data structures. I have picked this way of doing things since it would be most familiar with most languages. If you would like to be a little bit more familiar with classes and how to create them, I have added an extra video from one of my other courses: The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery which goes over this topic in the next lecture.<br><br>If you are already familiar with this topic you can skip over to the<strong> Implementing An Array </strong>video. <br><br>Ps, throughout the course I use <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code> to declare variables. It is not important that you understand the differences between them for this course, but if you are curious, I recommend reading this: <a href="https://dev.to/sethusenthil/var-vs-let-vs-const-1cgc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://dev.to/sethusenthil/var-vs-let-vs-const-1cgc</a></p>
