<p>Javascript as a language gives a great demonstration of how Stacks and Queues work. If you would like to be a little bit more familiar with how they work or how things like "Stackoverflow" happen, I have added an extra video from one of my other courses: <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/courses" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery</strong></a> which goes over this topic in the next lecture.<br><br>If you are already familiar with this topic you can skip over to the<strong> Exercise: Stack Implementation </strong>video. </p>
