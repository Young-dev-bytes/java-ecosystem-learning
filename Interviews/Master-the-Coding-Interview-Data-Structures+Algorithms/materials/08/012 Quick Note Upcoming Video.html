<p>A quick heads up! In the next lecture we will create the insert() method. For those astute programmers, you may notice that the solution has a bug if <code>index === 0</code>. In this case, all you need to do is to insert into the code a condition:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">if (index === 0) {
  this.prepend(value);
  return this.printList();
}</pre>
