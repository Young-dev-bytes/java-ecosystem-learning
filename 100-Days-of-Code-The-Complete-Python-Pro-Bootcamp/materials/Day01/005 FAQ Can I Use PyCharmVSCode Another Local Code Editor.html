<p>On <strong>day 15</strong> of the course, I will show you how to install and set up <strong>PyCharm</strong>, the most popular Python local code editor. </p><p>In the meantime (between day 1 and day 15) we will be using <strong>Replit</strong> a browser-based code editor. This has a number of advantages:</p><p>1. We can get up and running immediately, with less time wasted on setup and troubleshooting, more time learning to code.</p><p>2. It's accessible anywhere, any computer/iPad/phone that's connected to the internet can be used to code. </p><p>3. Your code and progress are saved, ready for you to review and revisit at any time. </p><p>4. It's free.</p><p><br></p><p>If you already have PyCharm or another code editor installed, feel free to use it. But the videos are recorded with replit so you might have a harder time trying to figure out how to do something in your local editor. But if you are advanced then feel free to choose. </p><p>I recommend everyone start with replit as I do in the videos and to follow along. As a developer, we need to learn to use many tools and the more your know the better. Then when we reach day 15, we will learn to use PyCharm. Even if you have a preferred tool, you might find something new. </p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2021-11-15_13-07-11-f2de471a14d55a07ae61812aa69c58b1.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p>
