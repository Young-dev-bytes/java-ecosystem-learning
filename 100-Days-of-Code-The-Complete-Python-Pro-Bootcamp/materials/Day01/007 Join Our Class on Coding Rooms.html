There are days missing in the coding rooms e.g. why am I missing days between 13 and 26?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>You are not missing anything. There are no coding exercises for those days because the projects are longer and are more involved. This is what I see too:</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2021-12-03_11-50-21-b567a494db493b9b2ce1cdc05e55549a.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>FAQ 2: Should I Use Repl.it or Coding Rooms?</strong></p><p>repl.it is a code editor that we are using for the first 15 days of the course. It requires no setup and is easy to use, we will continue to use it for projects and general coding. Coding rooms is an automated coding exercise platform that we'll use to check your code only for the lessons labelled [Interactive Coding Exercise]. Previously, we used repl.it for the coding exercises as well and the links to the repl.it exercises are still in the course resource links. You can choose which you prefer. I personally think that coding rooms has a slightly better UI but it really doesn't matter. What matters is you can write code.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>FAQ 3:&nbsp;When I go to Coding Rooms I don't see a Run button. </strong></p><p>Try a different browser (I recommend Chrome) and make sure you don't have any VPN enabled or a firewall blocking the website.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
