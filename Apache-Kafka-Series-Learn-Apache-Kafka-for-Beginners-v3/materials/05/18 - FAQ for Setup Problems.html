<h4><strong>Please refer to this lecture first if you have set up problems. </strong></h4><p><br></p><p>We recommend starting Kafka with <a href="https://conduktor.io/download" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Conduktor</a> if you're having issues even after troubleshooting</p><p><br></p><p>=====================</p><p><strong>&gt; Zookeeper - java.net.BindException: Address already in use</strong></p><p>Something is already occupying your port 2181.

Figure out what it is and stop it.<br>Otherwise, if you really insist, you can change the Kafka port by adding the following line to <code>server.properties </code></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">#&nbsp;example for port 9093

Data is only retained for 7 days. </p><p><strong>&gt; The topics list is disappearing</strong></p><p>Make sure you have changed the Zookeeper <code>dataDir=/path/to/data/zookeeper</code> , and Kafka <code>log.dirs=/path/to/data/kafka</code> </p><p><strong>&gt; I have launched Kafka in a VM&nbsp;or in the Cloud, and I&nbsp;can't produce to Kafka </strong></p><p>If you can't produce to Kafka, it's possible you are using a VM&nbsp;and this can break the Kafka behaviour. Please look at the annex lectures for solutions of how to deal with that. I&nbsp;strongly recommend doing this tutorial using the Kafka binaries and localhost</p>
