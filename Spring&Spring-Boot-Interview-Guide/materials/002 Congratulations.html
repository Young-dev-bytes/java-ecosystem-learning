            <p>You have made a great choice in choosing this course. You are joining 80,000 learners who have chosen in28Minutes as their learning partner. Thank You for <strong><em>6500+ 5-Star Reviews</em></strong><em> </em>on our courses. We are confident that you will love this course.</p>

<p><strong>Three things</strong> you would need to know before starting the course:</p>

<ol><li><p><strong><em>Set Yourselves a Goal</em></strong> - <em>Spend at least 28 minutes everyday, with this course, for the next week</em>.</p></li><li><p>Udemy asks a review very early in the course and at multiple intervals. If you feel you are not ready to leave a review, feel free to skip the review using the ’Skip’ or ‘I’ll respond later’ or ‘Cancel' buttons at the bottom of your review screen.</p></li><li><p>Subtitles for this course are still primitive - at <em>alpha level</em>. Udemy is providing these as a test. We are working on them and they should improve over a period of time.</p></li></ol>

<p>Have a little bit of patience for the first two hours and you should love it :)</p>

<p>Good Luck with the Course.</p>
