/**
 * Class {@code JobName} is a printing attribute class, a text attribute, that
 * specifies the name of a print job. A job's name is an arbitrary string
 * defined by the client. It does not need to be unique between different jobs.
 * A Print Job's {@code JobName} attribute is set to the value supplied by the
 * client in the Print Request's attribute set. If, however, the client does not
 * supply a {@code JobName} attribute in the Print Request, the printer, when it
 * creates the Print Job, must generate a {@code JobName}. The printer should
 * generate the value of the Print Job's {@code JobName} attribute from the
 * first of the following sources that produces a value: (1) the
 * {@link DocumentName DocumentName} attribute of the first (or only) doc in the
 * job, (2) the {@code URL} of the first (or only) doc in the job, if the doc's
 * print data representation object is a {@code URL}, or (3) any other piece of
 * Print Job specific and/or document content information.
 * <p>
 * <b>IPP Compatibility:</b> The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 * locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
 * {@code getName()} gives the IPP attribute name.
