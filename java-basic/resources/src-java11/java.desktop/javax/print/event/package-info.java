/**
 * Package {@code javax.print.event} contains event classes and listener
 * interfaces.
 * <p>
 * They may be used to monitor both print services (such as printers going
 * on-line &amp; off-line), and the progress of a specific print job.
 * <p>
 * Please note: In the {@code javax.print} APIs, a {@code null} reference
 * parameter to methods is incorrect unless explicitly documented on the method
 * as having a meaningful interpretation. Usage to the contrary is incorrect
 * coding and may result in a run time exception either immediately or at some
 * later time. {@code IllegalArgumentException} and {@code NullPointerException}
 * are examples of typical and acceptable run time exceptions for such cases.
