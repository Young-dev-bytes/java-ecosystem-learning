/** <P> This class implements a factory mechanism for the objects
    created to wrap Addresses. It requires that the class passed in
    implement a constructor taking with the following signature: </P>

    <P>
    <CODE> public &lt;Type&gt;(sun.jvm.hotspot.Address)
    </CODE>
    </P>

    <P> It is used to write shorter code when wrapping Addresses since
    null checks are no longer necessary. In addition, it is a central
    location where a canonicalizing map could be implemented if one
    were desired (though the current system is designed to not require
    one.) </P>
