<p>In this exercise we are going to implement a&nbsp; <code>MultiExecutor</code> .</p><p>The client of this class will create a list of <code>Runnable</code> tasks and provide that list into <code>MultiExecutor</code>'s constructor.</p><p>When the client runs the . <code>executeAll()</code>,&nbsp; the <code>MultiExecutor</code>,&nbsp; will execute all the given tasks.</p><p>To take full advantage of our multicore CPU, we would like the <code>MultiExecutor</code> to execute all the tasks in parallel, by passing each task to a different thread.</p><p> </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">import java.util.ArrayList;
