<h4><strong>Welcome to the Coding Lectures<br></strong></h4><p>Welcome to the<em> Java Multithreading, Concurrency &amp; Performance Optimization</em> course. Iam very excited to have you onboard and to give you a great learning experience.</p><p><br>For your convenience, from this point on, every lecture that involves a coding example also includes a <em>downloadable resource </em>with the source code for that particular lecture.<br>To get the most out of the course it is <strong>highly recommended</strong> for you to download the source code and experiment with it in order to get comfortable with the concepts discussed in the lecture.<br></p><h4><strong>Important Tips for following along the Coding Lectures</strong></h4><p>Following and understanding the practical examples is crucial to your success. </p><p>It's important to acknowledge (and celebrate) that we are all different. <br>We have different levels of experience with Java. We all think and read at a different pace, and for some of us, English is a second language.</p><p>The great news are: You are the pilot and you are in full control!<br>As part of being an active student, you should use the video player buttons<strong> </strong>to decide the right speed and pace for you.</p><p><br>I encourage you to pause, replay and slow down at any point you feel necessary, as many times as necessary.</p><p>This is a normal process and is the best part about being a student on <em>Udemy</em>.</p><p>If in the end of the lecture you still have questions, I am here to help you in the Q&amp;A section.<br><br>And most importantly.<br>Have fun!</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Debugging Java Threads in IntelliJ IDE</strong></h4><p>1. Set a breakpoint anywhere in your code. To set a breakpoint, right click on the line where you want the debugger to stop the execution of your application. The breakpoint appears as a red circle.</p><figure><img height="253" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2018-12-15_18-44-40-57b123cf766457c46a708dfe91118d4c.png" width="712"></figure><p>2.
