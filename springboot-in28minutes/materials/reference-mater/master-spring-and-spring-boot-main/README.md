# Master Spring and Spring Boot

**Spring and Spring Boot** Frameworks are the **No 1 frameworks** for building enterprise apps in the Java world.

In this course, you will **learn Spring and Spring Boot from ZERO**.

I'm a great believer that the best way to learn is by doing and we designed this course to be **hands-on**.

You will build a **web application, a REST API and full stack application** using Spring, Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate,
React, Spring Security, Maven and Gradle.

You will learn to containerise applications using Docker. You will learn to deploy these applications to AWS.

By the end of the course, you will know everything you would need to become a great Spring and Spring Boot Developer.

## Installing Tools

### Our Recommendations

- Use **latest version** of Java
- Use **latest version** of "Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers"
- Remember: Spring Boot 3+ works only with Java 17+
